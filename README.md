# Assignment1
Intial idea:
My idea for the assignment is to redesign Craigslist website. This is because the current website is not so user-friendly and outdated and needs a lot of improvements. The redesign will make it more user-friendly and have a better looking user interface. Some of my ideas would be categorizing the classified advertisements in a proper manner as well as scroll to change the categories when looking at the ads and creating an advertisement. The website allows users to search for advertisements as well as create listings.

I referred to slides as well as w3 schools for some of the codes. I also looked up for the javascript code and added for user interaction. 

Firstly I created a index page to create the homepage. Then I added login button and create a post button that links to the respective pages. After that I coded the login and create a post pages so that user can login and post advertisements. I also added javascript code for users to accept cookies. I added a view listing link so that users can view the existing advertisements posted. I made sure I linked the javascript and the css pages to the appopriate html files. I also added buttons so that user can click on them to sumbit posts and click login.
